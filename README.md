# Diabetes-Prediction
Detects the diabetes in Females.
Predict Diabetes using Machine Learning.

In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one.
